Changes to
angelov_gan.va Rev. 2.22.24052023 contributed by Prof. I. Angelov on 4.1.24:

- G-R Noise commented out per macro HAVE_GRN_NOISE because openVAF has no $frequency access
- Cdel=0 follows in short between nodes gsi and si because of node collapsing
- Node vrf is dangling and not needed, Variable Vrf is V(rf) and used for Idsmod 4
- Vgd duplicated
- Vpks_T not used
- Rc_T not used
- psi_1 double defined
- there is no Capmod=6
- V(g,ggi) <+ I(g,ggi) * `SPICE_GMIN leakage resistance
- Lw is in mm but no factor 1e-2
- don't mix ddt() with non-ddt contributions (ADMS)
