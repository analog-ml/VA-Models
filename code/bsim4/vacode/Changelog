General update in parameter handling inline with common Verilog-A compact model code of practice.

Change contributions to flow.

Remove potential contribution branches for non-XYCE simulators

XYCE allow only current contribution for white_noise function

Use named branches for RD / RS branch for separate potential / flow contribution

For ADMS/Xyce use @(initial_instance) instead of @(initial_step)

Repair bug for wrong wk2 init caused total wrong bulk control

Rename instance parameter min to minsd to avoid to conflict with va builtin function min()

Change model parameter to instance parameter

Use simulator provided gmin 

Remove the ADMS/Xyce specific workaround for non-ability node collapsing

Remove obsolete variables left over by the assumed C code transformation.
Remaining unused variables are for noise model which is deactivated.

Whenever the provided examples showing reasonable results compared to build-in model
the va-code looks more as experimental and uses unusual parameter initialization.
