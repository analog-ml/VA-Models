Changes for ADMS/Xyce:
Rename module to bjt504_va - not to come in conflict with Xyce build-in code
Xyce specific limiting functions
Remove gmuz value in opinfo.inc, because adms can't use unary access function for ddx()

Use alternative ngspice specific limit function pnjlim for inner base-emitter and base-collector junctions

Use disciplines.vams
